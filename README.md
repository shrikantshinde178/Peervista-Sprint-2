# Peervista-Sprint-2
This is an updated version of the peervista-sprint-1 Insurance platform project

PeerVista is a web application built on Spring Boot (backend), Angular (frontend), Hibernate, and MySQL that facilitates peer-to-peer lending and borrowing. Users can:

- Create accounts (login and signup)
- Manage policies (apply, store, update, delete)
- Track records

The application prioritizes security, ease of use, and comprehensive insurance management.

## Project Structure

This repository consists of two subdirectories:

- `frontend`: Contains the Angular code for the user interface.
- `backend`: Contains the Spring Boot code for the server-side logic and API.

## Getting Started

Each subdirectory has its own `README.md` file with detailed setup, development, and testing instructions.

## Previous Version
